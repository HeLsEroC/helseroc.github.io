<h2 id="what-it-is">What it is?.</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs see what wikipedia says about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for
data types. An abstract data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from
the point of view of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible
values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these
operations. This mathematical model contrasts with data structures, which are
concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer,
not a user.</p>
